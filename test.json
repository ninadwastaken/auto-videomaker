{"subreddit": "AmItheAsshole", "text": "So I (18M) have a half sister Elizabeth (26F). We share a mom. My dad became her stepdad when she was 5/6. Her dad is/was a deadbeat. She never knew him really. She did have his mom in her life for a while until she died when Elizabeth was 7ish.\n\nMy dad really did his best to be a good stepdad and father figure for Elizabeth. My mom always hoped Elizabeth would grow to love my dad and consider him her dad. He went above and beyond from what I can tell for her. They also made sure she didn't feel replaced or ignored after I was born. But she always had some kind of distain for my dad. Unless she wanted something/could get something from him. She would tell him that he was not her dad or parent but if she wanted something or if Christmas/her birthday she would not call him dad but would mention he wanted to be.\n\nShe never gave a shit about me and was coolly indifferent to me my whole life, with some honest dislike mixed in. I felt it. She admitted it. She told me constantly that we weren't real siblings and she didn't give a shit about me. But she would play pretend when others were watching. There were times she really gave a good show too. But when nobody was looking her true colors shone through.\n\nNothing changed when she became an adult. I don't think we have said a single thing to each other in the 8 years since she moved out. And we have been in the same room since then.\n\nMy dad still does his best to be there for her but she still treats him like he's a stain on her shoe.\n\nShe got engaged a few months ago and told my dad this whole spiel about how he was there for her, etc, and how they weren't sure if they could afford a nice wedding and she was wondering if he would pay. He said of course. She practically ran like her ass was on fire once she got the money. Then she announced that she had met her bio dad and he would be father of the bride at her wedding and my dad was a regular old guest. My dad took it all in stride but mom took it badly and she cried when she realized Elizabeth had used him for money. She realized Elizabeth never once said she appreciated or was glad dad had done all this nice stuff. Just that he had.\n\nI wasn't mentioned on the invite for the wedding and never got my own but when mom asked she said sure I was invited. That basically told me all I needed to know but even before that I didn't care if I was invited, I knew I wouldn't go.\n\nI told my parents. Mom was upset. She said we were so close, etc. I told her no and pointed out how she has admitted to my face she doesn't give a shit and how she hasn't said a single word to me since I was 10. My dad had his eyes open somewhat but said he would still go, he still loves her, etc. I told him he should take a stand given all he is to her is someone who buys nice things, not someone she cares about at all. My mom said that wasn't fair. We need to be there for the wedding. I shouldn't encourage dad to stop caring. She said I'm behaving badly like Elizabeth has.\n\nAITA?"}
